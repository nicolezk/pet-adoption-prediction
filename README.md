# pet-adoption-prediction
This repository contains the code for the project of the Machine Learning course given at Universitat Politécnica de Cataluña (UPC).

## Data
The data was obtained from [Kaggle's "PetFinder.my Adoption Prediction"](https://www.kaggle.com/c/petfinder-adoption-prediction/data) competition.

## How to execute and reproduce results

## Project description
The project should cover all aspects of the modelling methodology seen in class from preprocessing to generating a final predictive model together with an assessment of its prediction quality.

### Deliverables
**0. Project proposal** (1 page). It should include the composition of your team, the problem that you are going to work on, the reason why you chose it, together with any references of previous work on this problem if applicable, and a title for your project; please include information on the data such as number of rows, columns, and nature of variables (e.g. if categorical, how many levels).

**1. Written report** (max 15 pages). This document should describe the work carried out, its motivation, the problems encountered and the solutions found together with final resuts and conclusions of your study. The final report should include:
- A brief description of the work and its goals, data available, and any additional information that you
may have used.
- Related previous work (if applicable)
- The data exploration process, including: pre-processing, feature selection/extraction, visualization, clustering, etc.
- Modeling methods considered, validation protocol and the reasons why the choices were made.
- Results obtained with each method used (along with best set of parameters), comparison of results.
- Final model chosen and an estimation of its generalization performance.
- Scientific and personal conclusions
- Possible extensions and known limitations.

**2. Any script or code you have used** (python notebooks, scripts, or any other code)

**3. A flat text file with precise instructions on how to execute and reproduce your results**

**4. Poster or video**. The poster should summarize the most important aspects of the project. Alternatively, you can produce a short video (no more than 3-4 minutes) explaining the most important parts of your work. All members of the team should participate in the video more or less equally if you decide to do that.
